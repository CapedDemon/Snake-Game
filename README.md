# Snake Game
Snake Games are the msot favourite game of all time. It is very fun to play it and make the highest score. It is alsovery much addicive. Snake Games are available in application form as well as web form also. 
<br>
For developers and coders snake games are the most basic and easiest thing to make and play.
<br>
I used to play the snake games when I was too small. Today at 14 years of age I thought of making my own snake games. Before I have made much complex games like the BUG Outbreak in python. But it will be more fun to make two snake games with different language and platforms. Here I have made two snake games :-
- Web -> Javascript, html, css
- Application -> python
I have kept them in same folder.

# How to play?
You all know how to play a **snake game**. But then also, I am telling you the instruction to play my snake games.
- You can use up, down, left, right arrow key for moving the snake or w, a, s, d for moving the snakes. Both can be used.
- If yu touch the walls, game overs or if you bump into yourself you lose
- If you eat the **red** color thing, then your point increases.

That's all.
The web version you can find in - https://bit.ly/3FATyY4

You can get the application, by cloning the git repository - 
```
git clone https://github.com/Shreejan-35/Snake-Game.git

```
Then run the snake.py file. For this install python 3 on your device.
Navigate to the clone folder and open terminal - (cmd, powershell, bash, etc) and run this -
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
